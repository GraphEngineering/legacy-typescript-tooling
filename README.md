# Typescript Tooling // `tst`

A tool for creating and managing TypeScript projects with minimal configuration.

## Features

TypeScript's developer experience is a major improvement over vanilla
JavaScript, however, configuring and managing everything needed to be productive
is still a major hassle. That's why TypeScript Tooling (`tst`)...

- üõ†Ô∏è Provides reasonable defaults for [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript), [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), and [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)
- üêâ Uses a monorepo project structure with help from [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)
- üì¶ Installs and saves the `devDependencies` needed to get up and running
- üìù Generates `npm scripts` for your packages (`test`, `test:watch`, `dev`, and `build`)

## Getting Started

1. Install `tst`

```
npm install --save-dev typescript-tooling
```

2. Run the `init` command

```
npx tst init
```

3. **That's it!**

Here's a few scripts to try...

```
npm run example:test
```

```
npm run example:dev
```

```
npm run example:build
```

## How does TST work?

TST writes default config files to the `.tst` directory whenever `tst init` is
executed. Commands like `tst build <package-name>` simply run a CLI command
assuming those defaults are in place. For example, `tst test <package-name>`
runs the command `npx jest packages/<package-name>`.

Nothing special is happening here! Feel free to run these commands on your own
without using TST. Since no magic is involved, it's easy to stop using this
tool, just move the files in `.tst` to root of the project and add the commands
TST generates to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.
